<a name="overview"></a><h2>Building GNOME Print on UNIX-like systems</h2>
<p>
      This chapter covers building and installing GNOME Print on UNIX and
      UNIX-like systems such as Linux.
    </p>
<p>
      Before we get into the details of how to compile GNOME Print, we should
      mention that in many cases, binary packages of GNOME Print prebuilt for
      your operating system will be available, either from your
      operating system vendor or from independent sources. If such a
      set of packages is available, installing it will get you
      programming wih GNOME Print much faster than building it yourself. In
      fact, you may well already have GNOME Print installed on your system
      already.
    </p>
<p>
      On UNIX-like systems GNOME Print uses the standard GNU build system,
      using <span class="application">autoconf</span> for package
      configuration and resolving portability issues,
      <span class="application">automake</span> for building makefiles that
      comply with the GNU Coding Standards, and
      <span class="application">libtool</span> for building shared libraries
      on multiple platforms.
    </p>
<p>
      If you are building GNOME Print from the distributed source packages,
      then won't need these tools installed; the necessary pieces
      of the tools are already included in the source packages. But
      it's useful to know a bit about how packages that use these
      tools work. A source package is distributed as a
      <code class="literal">tar.gz</code> file which you unpack into a 
      directory full of the source files as follows:
    </p>
<pre class="programlisting">
      tar xvfz libgnomeprint-2.0.0.tar.gz
    </pre>
<p>
      In the toplevel of the directory that is created, there will be
      a shell script called <code class="filename">configure</code> which
      you then run to take the template makefiles called
      <code class="filename">Makefile.in</code> in the package and create
      makefiles customized for your operating system. The <code class="filename">configure</code>
      script can be passed various command line arguments to determine how
      the package is built and installed. The most commonly useful
      argument is the <code class="systemitem">--prefix</code> argument which
      determines where the package is installed. To install a package
      in <code class="filename">/opt/libgnomeprint</code> you would run configure as:
    </p>
<pre class="programlisting">
      ./configure --prefix=/opt/libgnomeprint
    </pre>
<p>
      A full list of options can be found by running
      <code class="filename">configure</code> with the
      <code class="systemitem">--help</code> argument. In general, the defaults are
      right and should be trusted. After you've run
      <code class="filename">configure</code>, you then run the
      <span class="command"><strong>make</strong></span> command to build the package and install
      it.
    </p>
<pre class="programlisting">
      make
      make install
    </pre>
<p>
      If you don't have permission to write to the directory you are
      installing in, you may have to change to root temporarily before
      running <code class="literal">make install</code>. Also, if you are
      installing in a system directory, on some systems (such as
      Linux), you will need to run <span class="command"><strong>ldconfig</strong></span> after
      <code class="literal">make install</code> so that the newly installed
      libraries will be found.
    </p>
<p>
      Several environment variables are useful to pass to set before
      running configure. <code class="envar">CPPFLAGS</code> contains options to
      pass to the C compiler, and is used to tell the compiler where
      to look for include files. The <code class="envar">LDFLAGS</code> variable
      is used in a similar fashion for the linker. Finally the
      <code class="envar">PKG_CONFIG_PATH</code> environment variable contains
      a search path that <span class="command"><strong>pkg-config</strong></span> (see below)
      uses when looking for for file describing how to compile
      programs using different libraries. If you were installing GNOME Print
      and it's dependencies into <code class="filename">/opt/libgnomeprint</code>, you
      might want to set these variables as:
    </p>
<pre class="programlisting">
      CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/libgnomeprint/include"
      LDFLAGS="-L/opt/libgnomeprint/lib"
      PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/opt/libgnomeprint/lib/pkgconfig"
      export CPPFLAGS LDFLAGS PKG_CONFIG_PATH
    </pre>
<p>
      You may also need to set the <code class="envar">LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>
      environment variable so the systems dynamic linker can find
      the newly installed libraries, and the <code class="envar">PATH</code>
      environment program so that utility binaries installed by
      the various libraries will be found.
    </p>
<pre class="programlisting">
      LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/opt/libgnomeprint/lib"
      PATH="/opt/libgnomeprint/bin:$PATH"
      export LD_LIBRARY_PATH PATH
    </pre>

      Before you can compile the GNOME Print, you need to have
      various other tools and libraries installed on your
      system. The two tools needed during the build process (as
      differentiated from the tools used in when creating GNOME Print
      mentioned above such as <span class="application">autoconf</span>)
      are <span class="command"><strong>pkg-config</strong></span> and GNU make.
    </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">

	  <a class="ulink" href="http://www.freedesktop.org/software/pkgconfig/" target="_top">pkg-config</a>

	  libraries that is used by the GNOME Print library. (A small
	  <code class="literal">.pc</code> text file is installed in a standard
	  location that contains the compilation flags needed for the
	  library along with version number information.)
	</p></li>
<li><p>
	  The GNOME Print makefiles will mostly work with different versions
	  of <span class="command"><strong>make</strong></span>, however, there tends to be
	  a few incompatibilities, so the GNOME Print team recommends
	  installing <a class="ulink" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make" target="_top">GNU
	    make</a> if you don't already have it on your system
	  and using it. (It may be called <span class="command"><strong>gmake</strong></span>
	  rather than <span class="command"><strong>make</strong></span>.)

<p>
      First make sure that you have the necessary dependencies installed:
      <span class="command"><strong>pkg-config</strong></span>, GNU make, libart, libxml2, libbonobo, glib,
      and, if necessary, libintl. To get detailed information about building 
      these packages, see the documentation provided with the
      individual packages.
      On a Linux system, it's quite likely you'll have all of these
      installed already except for <span class="command"><strong>pkg-config</strong></span>.
    </p>
<p>
      Then build and install the GNOME Print library, follow the
      steps of <code class="literal">configure</code>, <code class="literal">make</code>,
      <code class="literal">make install</code> mentioned above. If you're
      lucky, this will all go smoothly, and you'll be ready to
      <a class="link" href="libgnomeprint-compiling.html" title="Compiling GNOME Print Applications">start compiling your own
      GNOME Print applications</a>.
    </p>
<p>
      If the <code class="filename">configure</code> scripts fails or running
      <span class="command"><strong>make</strong></span> fails, look closely at the error
      messages printed; these will often provide useful information
      as to what went wrong. When <code class="filename">configure</code>
      fails, extra information, such as errors that a test compilation
      ran into, is found in the file <code class="filename">config.log</code>.
      Looking at the last couple of hundred lines in this file will
      frequently make clear what went wrong. If all else fails, you
      can ask for help on the gnome-print mailing list.
      See <a class="xref" href="libgnomeprint-resources.html" title="Mailing lists and bug reports"><span class="refentrytitle">Mailing lists and bug reports</span>(3)</a> for more information.

	In addition to the normal options, the

	  The <span class="application">gtk-doc</span> package is
