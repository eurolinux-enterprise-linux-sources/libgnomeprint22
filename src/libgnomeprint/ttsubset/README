gnome-print-tt-subset.c contains gnome_print_pdf_tt_create_subfont function, 
which actually takes in a ttf file_name and a glyphArray/encoding array of 
length len, and returns a subfont file created in subfont_file. This subfont 
is a standalone ttf font, encoded in symbol format.

This also contains gnome_print_ps_tt_create_subfont, which creates a type 42
subfont in the similar manner. This is needed for embedding truetype data 
directly in PS output.
